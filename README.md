2.) Dashboard - From Dashboard user can have access to "Insert Student (Individual student)", "Update Student", "List Students", "Delete student" and "Upload File" views.

Insert Student (Individual student) - This view will allow the admin to add student info individually.

Insert Student (Bulk) - This view will allow the admin to add student via CSV file upload. Please used the attached file.

Update Student - This view will allow the admin to edit particular student information.

List Students - This view will allow the admin to see all student info together in 1 screen.

Delete student - This view will allow the admin to delete the student.

3.) Student information should be shown in tabular format with search and sort feature
